# Hi there! 👋

I am [Yinda Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hCvlj5cAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), a master's student in Computer Science and Technology at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), currently transitioned to a Ph.D. candidate in Electronic Information Engineering at USTC. Here’s a little bit about me:

- 👀 I am passionate about remote sensing and biomedical image processing. My research focuses on self-supervised pretraining and efficient fine-tuning, and I also handle some tasks related to image encoding and compression within my group.
- 🌱 I am currently exploring the fascinating world of computer science and technology at USTC. My advisors are [Feng Wu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5bInRDEAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Zhiwei Xiong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Snl0HPEAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). I also maintain close collaboration with [Dong Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lOWByxoAAAAJ&hl=en), [Li Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dEm6VKAAAAAJ&hl=en), and have conducted research internships at Imperial College London and the 301 Hospital. My collaborators include [Qionghai Dai](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CHAajY4AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and [Rossella Arcucci](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oxy2ZQoAAAAJ&hl=en).
- 💞️ I have a diverse academic background, having earned a double bachelor's degree in Environmental Science and Economics, and participated in the statistical research group [WISERCLUB](https://github.com/wise-r) at WISE, Xiamen University. I also have experience in mathematical competitions. I pursued my master's in Computer Science (CS) and am currently studying for my Ph.D. in Electronic Information Engineering (EE). I am eager to collaborate across various fields, including but not limited to remote sensing and biomedical image processing.
- 📄 My full resume is available [here](https://ydchen0806.github.io/). You can find the PDF versions in [Chinese](https://github.com/ydchen0806/ydchen0806/blob/main/cyd_resume_CN.pdf) and [English](https://github.com/ydchen0806/ydchen0806/blob/main/CYD_resume_EN.pdf).
- 🎓 I am also urgently looking for **research internship positions** related to large model theory, pretraining, and efficient fine-tuning. If there are any available positions, 🙏 I would be grateful for the chance to further discuss my qualifications. Thank you for your consideration. 🌟
